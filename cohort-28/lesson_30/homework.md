**Задача 1**

Write OddEvenComparator implementing Comparator with the method compare for sorting an array of Integers in the order:
The even integers should go before odd numbers.

**Задача 2 (advanced)**

Update OddEvenComparator with the method compare for sorting an array of Integers in the order: 
The even integers should go before odd numbers  in the ascending order . 
The odd integers should go after the even ones in the descending order. 
Write Junit Test Case for OddEvenComparator.  <br/>
Integer[] origin = { 1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 9, 8, 7, 3 }; <br/>
Integer[] expected = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 7, 5, 3, 3, 1 }; <br/>
